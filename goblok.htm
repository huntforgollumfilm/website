                  <p class="Question">Into the West</p>
                  <p class="NewsBody">I  got involved with the &lsquo;Hunt for Gollum&rsquo; after working on &lsquo;Human Residue&rsquo;.&nbsp; The problem is I can&rsquo;t remember what it was I  originally signed up to do&hellip;&nbsp; I think it  was being an orc because I remember going to have my head cast before the Wales  shoot.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m almost completely sure about  that.&nbsp; However the first thing I did  during shooting was in the camera department.&nbsp;  I was going to assist Mike (<em>Ritchie: DoP</em>) on the trailer/test shoot  in Wales which was great because I&rsquo;d been getting experience as a lighting  assistant and I wanted to get into the camera department as well.&nbsp; Unfortunately when it came to the shoot Mike  couldn&rsquo;t make it so I got to be cameraman.&nbsp;  That was great in, and of, itself but, while there, I also remember  reading some of the lines for Gollum (&ldquo;screaming maniac in campsite car park&rdquo;  the local papers called it) and Chris (<em>Bouchard: Dir/Prod</em>) liked my  ramblings, so that ensured I was going to be on board a little longer.&nbsp; Even better!<br>
                    <br>
                   Wales had some pretty tough locations&hellip;&nbsp; Up a mountain in the rain springs to mind,  but it didn&rsquo;t really seem as hard at the time because of how everyone on the  film worked together.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve  worked on anything else where the whole crew has worked so hard and been so  enthusiastic about the project.&nbsp; It  really does make all the difference when everybody wants to be involved and  gives everything to make it happen.&nbsp;  However the Wales shoot was nothing compared to what happened once H4G  returned to London.&nbsp;</p>
                  <p class="Question">Concerning Orcs</p>
                  <p class="NewsBody">What I was looking forward  to the most on &lsquo;The Hunt for Gollum&rsquo; was the opportunity to be an Orc.&nbsp; Initially the big ugly orc (that&rsquo;s me) was  meant to get his head cut off in the first few moments of the fight, enraging  the others to redouble their attack on Aragorn.&nbsp;  However with an insidious nature that is natural to all orcs, slowly my  character developed into something a little bit bigger (because I put on  weight) and nastier (because I wasn&rsquo;t happy about this).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s akin to the situation where you name  livestock and they subsequently become harder to slaughter when the time  comes.&nbsp; When Goblok (it means &lsquo;war chief&rsquo;  in the black speech of Mordor and &lsquo;stupid&rsquo; in Indonesian) got his name he  couldn&rsquo;t just be swatted in the opening scenes of the fight.&nbsp; Goblok Half-Troll demanded more!<br>
                    <br>
   Chris kept changing what Goblok would be  doing and kept building up the character&rsquo;s involvement in fight scene.&nbsp; This was simultaneously really exciting and a  bit worrying.&nbsp; While I was glad I got to  do a bit more than grunt and fall over I had very little acting experience (I  had been a creature on Rob Grayson and Ade Webster&rsquo;s (Aragorn) film &lsquo;John  Commando&rsquo;, so I was familiar with running around in the woods like a lunatic whilst  wearing a mask) but this had choreographed fight scenes!&nbsp; I had absolutely no fight experience before I  came on board.&nbsp; That meant Ruth (<em>Cooper-Brown:  Fight Coordinator</em>) and Rachel (<em>Bown-Williams: Fight Coordinator</em>) of  RC-Annie had to train me up from scratch.<br>
  <br>
   While at rehearsals Ruth and Rachel would  concentrate on training the fight team while Chris schooled us on being  orcs.&nbsp; Between choreography and running  through the fight I wanted to feign ignorance of &lsquo;orcy ways&rsquo; so Chris would  have to demonstrate my character.&nbsp; I  never got the chance.&nbsp; He was only too  happy to start lumbering around like an orc, and I can only hope there&rsquo;s some  of it on the behind the scenes camera.                  </p>
                  <p class="Question">The Forests of Epping</p>
                  <p class="NewsBody">The  big day rolled around and it started off really well.&nbsp; I remember going to the orc shoot expecting  to see Luke with a bag of latex masks and a bucket of body paint.&nbsp; When I arrived and saw a couple of dozen  people putting half again as many orcs together I was amazed.&nbsp; That didn&rsquo;t include all the other crew, both  technical and production&hellip;&nbsp; Obviously  that&rsquo;s nothing compared with the big productions, but for a small, independent  project of volunteers it was really impressive.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
   What was great though was that the atmosphere  there was the same as before, everyone was working really hard to make it  happen and enjoying themselves.&nbsp; It was  tougher to organise because of the scale of the shoot (not that Goblok cared),  and there were times when we were rushing to get stuff done, but it was still a  great shoot because everyone was trying so hard to make sure it was successful.<br>
   <br>
   The prosthetics were literally hours of  fun.&nbsp; You sit down and have loads of the  special-effects makeup and prosthetics team prod you for around an hour.&nbsp; Then costume department would do the same but  with pins and glue guns.&nbsp; All the while  you just sit there and drink tea and talk incessantly (or at least that&rsquo;s what  I did).&nbsp; Then you get to go on set and  rampage around the woods in front of a camera.</p>
                  <span class="NewsBody">                  Initially the mask and costume poked me in  some odd places.&nbsp; However once I&rsquo;d worn  it for a bit and the makeup and costume departments had worked their magic  (mainly to stop me whining) the whole outfit was really comfortable.&nbsp; Seriously I was happy to spend the whole day  in it (which strangely enough I had to do).&nbsp;  I know some of the other guys and girls had trouble with the helmets  (Ivan (<em>Wilkinson: Fight Team</em>) and his crisps for instance), but I was  left free and easy.&nbsp; Not literally, mind  you.&nbsp; The worst I had to deal with was a  bit of sweatiness on the inside of the mask and mosquito bites.&nbsp; Oh&hellip; and lots and lots of fake blood.&nbsp; Really sticky, nasty fake blood&hellip; with bits  in!&nbsp; But nothing Goblok couldn&rsquo;t handle!</span>
<p class="Question">Goblok's Folly</p>
                  <p class="NewsBody">Now as for the fight scene  itself&hellip; By this point Goblok&rsquo;s axe had gone through various modifications and  repairs and was far too heavy after all was said and done (this was partly my  fault as I had been involved with the design and had actually cut the basic  shape out myself).&nbsp; It was, sensibly I  might add, deemed unsafe to use (Ade had more scenes to film and so wasn&rsquo;t  disposable yet), so the fight scene had to be altered appropriately, something  which Chris took in his stride and actually used to add interest to the  scene.&nbsp; Something else that felt  different: whereas in rehearsals we would run the whole fight through from  start to finish on camera you&rsquo;d do maybe ten seconds and then cut and do it  again.&nbsp; The timing and flow felt very  different.&nbsp; Not that I was thinking about  this too much.&nbsp; I was just concentrating  on remembering the moves and not breaking a) the weapon I&rsquo;d been given b) Ade  and c) anyone else who came in range.&nbsp; I  didn&rsquo;t have a chance to worry about how it was looking, but Chris and the  camera team would have let me know if I was making mistakes.<br>
                    <br>
   Another difficulty was resisting the urge to  be very, very childish.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a part  where Goblok gets clobbered and spits a gobbet of fake blood everywhere.&nbsp; It so happened that during the scene  &lsquo;everywhere&rsquo; became &lsquo;Mike&rsquo;s trousers&rsquo;.&nbsp;  The thing is every time I had another mouthful of the stuff (the blood,  not Mike&rsquo;s trousers) nasty thoughts would flit into my head&hellip;&nbsp; Should I bother worrying about the camera  when I let this stuff fly?&nbsp; Who could I  dribble on and make it look like an accident?&nbsp;  Has anyone left a drink unattended that I could defile?&nbsp; And so on&hellip;</p>
                  <span class="NewsBody"> Long story short we got everything on  camera.&nbsp; The last few scenes were hectic  and not a little fraught with danger seeing as Aragorn&rsquo;s sword had to come  quite close to my throat, but we got it all done in the end.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t seen it yet but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll look  great!&nbsp; Especially the bit where I  die!&nbsp; Goblok meets a really nasty end;  very messy (or it should be after the amount of blood and filth Luke (<em>McNalley:  Special Effects Supervisor</em>) sprayed all over me).&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure I should reveal it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not even sure Goblok <em>is</em> dead to be  honest.&nbsp; I like to think he&rsquo;s still out  there, living his awful, angry life somewhere in Epping Forest.</span>
<p class="Question">The Hunt Continues...</p>
                  <p class="NewsBody">It was sad to leave Goblok  behind.&nbsp; Those scenes were the most fun  I&rsquo;ve had on the project so far.&nbsp; I think  part of that was because it was so unlike anything I&rsquo;ve done before and also  because it&rsquo;s something so few people would get to do, especially with the support  of so many talented artists.&nbsp; I remember  watching Peter Jackson&rsquo;s trilogy, seeing Shagrat, Grishnahk, Lurtz, and  Sauron&rsquo;s Mouthpiece and envying the actors who got to play those  characters.&nbsp; Goblok is probably the  closest I&rsquo;ll get to Middle-Earth, but thanks to the amazing make-up, props and costume  it&rsquo;s pretty damn close.&nbsp; I reckon I  couldn&rsquo;t get a more authentic LOTR experience without actually managing to get  on &lsquo;The Hobbit&rsquo; (and if anyone concerned with that production is reading this,  I am available, keen and can bring my own pair of orc shoes!).&nbsp; <br>
                    <br>
                    Having said all that, some parts of the  filming have been uncomfortable and some have been more than a little  stressful, but the whole thing has been a fantastic experience.&nbsp; The moments where things don&rsquo;t go to plan are  all part of the process and it is what makes shooting a film so rewarding when  those issues can be overcome.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m still  blown away by the scale and ambition of the project and I&rsquo;m really grateful  I&rsquo;ve got to be so involved with it.<br>
                    <br>
                  Actually, thinking about it, the <em>best</em> part is&hellip;&nbsp; There&rsquo;s still more to come!                </p>
